Project includes: 
- main script, that runs experiment loop (emo_cue_dotprobe.py) and saves logfiles for each participant
- script to randomize stimulus presentation and generate controlfiles which are then used by the main experiment (emo_cue_dotprobe_st_files.py)
- script to get data from the logfiles generated by experiment and aggregate into one dataset (read_analyze_logfiles.py)

Main experiment runs most stable out of Psychopy standalone software.
